	String.split("")
		Splits a string by whatever string is specified. If " " is passed through as an argument, each word separated by a space in a sentence string 		will be added as an element of an array. Useful for parsing and manipulating text. 

		For example: array = "Split this sentence!".split(" ") 
		array returns [Split, this, sentence!]

	Array.push, or <<
		Pushes a specified element to the highest index in an array. Remarkable for its ease of use in my opinion.

		For example: array = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
		array <<  9
		array now returns [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
